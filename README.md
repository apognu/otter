Otter is a native Android music player for [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio), native to both Android (developed in Kotlin) and to Funkwhale (uses its native API instead of Subsonic).

You can get help and discuss Otter on Matrix on [#otter:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#otter:matrix.org).

## State

A beta version of the app can be downloaded on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.apognu.otter), on [IzzySoft](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/com.github.apognu.otter) (F-Droid-compatible repository) or through [GitHub releases](https://github.com/apognu/otter/releases). Please bear with it, there **will** be bugs, there **will** be crashes and there **will** be performance or UX issues.

Otter's features, are the following:

 * Basic collection browsing (artists, albums and tracks)
 * Playlists listing
 * Favorites management (listing and add/remove)
 * Track search
 * Queue management
 * Caching of played tracks (played tracks work offline)
 * Download tracks for offline playback
 * Radios playback
 * Dark mode!! ðŸŽ‰

Otter will try to behave as you would expect a mobile music player to, meaning integrating with the OS's media controls (including headset controls) or pause on incoming calls. If there is anything you would like it to do, please [open an issue](https://github.com/apognu/otter/issues/new).
